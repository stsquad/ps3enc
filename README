Alex's PS3 Ripping Scripts
==========================

The following scripts are used for ripping and encoding DVD's into a
format suitable for playing on a PS3 (h.264 encoded MP4's). All the
heavy encoding work is done the excellent mencoder.

There are currently two scripts

rip.py
------

The rip script is used to rip a DVD into 1-n separate VOB files. By
default it will rip the longest track on the DVD (assuming it to be
the main feature) and anything else within 80% of the size. This means
by default it should correctly rip a number of episodes if the DVD is
part of a TV box set. The exact threshold can be controlled by --max
flag. Episodes will be numbered from 1 unless the -e flag specifies a
new base.

Currently the script is hardwired to rip from /dev/dvd

The script requires the "lsdvd" utility to be installed to get the
chapter information from the DVD.

Unless -l is specified the script will automatically kick of ps3enc.py
to start encoding the VOB file. Otherwise the script will create a log
of files ripped that can be passed to an encoding process as ripping 4
episodes in one go on a single or duel core machine isn't actually
that efficient.
