Alex's PS3 Ripping Scripts
==========================

The following scripts are used for ripping and encoding DVD's into a
format suitable for playing on a PS3 (h.264 encoded MP4's). All the
heavy encoding work is done the excellent mencoder.

Why?
====

Every other solution I've tried sucks?

There are loads of ripping front-ends out there however they don't happen
to suit me. These scripts concentrate on being command line based, tuned
for the PS3 (may main media hub) and useful for ripping box sets by using
heuristics to identify the episodes on a disk.

It's also an exercise in coding more python for me. Having said that it's
all open source so I'll happily accept patches and your perfectly free to
fork it for your own needs.

Approach and prerequisites
==========================

The script is optimised for my setup. As the files are quite big
and a lot of the stuff in multi-pass is thrown away most of the heavy
file I/O is in /tmp which on my 16GB machine is huge tmpfs partition.
This means the encoding is rarely I/O bound which makes running multiple
encodes less of a load on my machine (which is a 2 core + 2 thread i5 system).

These scripts require the following:

* mencoder
* lsdvd
* MP4Box

Usage
=====

There are currently two scripts

rip.py
------

The rip script is used to rip a DVD into 1-n separate VOB files. It
attempts to calculate this by looking for the modal episode length
after having rounded to the nearest 6 minutes. If you explicitly
set the max times from the command line it will rip anything else
within 80% of the size.

The aim of this is to make ripping fairly seamless when presented with
a TV box set.

Episodes will be numbered from 1 unless the -b flag specifies a
new base.

The script requires the "lsdvd" utility to be installed to get the
chapter information from the DVD.

Unless -l/-r is specified the script will automatically kick of
ps3enc.py to start encoding the VOB file. Otherwise the script will
create a log of files ripped that can be passed to an encoding process
as ripping 4 episodes in one go on a single or duel core machine isn't
actually that efficient.

See --help for all the command line options.

ps3enc.py
---------

This script encodes video files into PS3 compliant MP4 files. By
default it does a 3 pass encode with a video bitrate of 2MBs.

It has a couple of presets:

  -c/--cartoon

  Single pass, lower bitrate, enables a filter that seems to improve
  encoding

  --film

  Higher video bitrate also increases the audio bitrate as films often
  have quite a dense soundtrack which benefits from it.
